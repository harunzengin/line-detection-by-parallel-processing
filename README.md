# Line detection with parallel processing
This is an Algorithm Analysis Project given in Boğaziçi University. It is written in C and uses MPI for parallelization.


## Getting Started

You need to have a C compiler, Python and MPI installed..
### Prerequisites

To install MPI, follow this guide.

* [MPI installation](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/sites/default/files/mpi_install_tutorial.pdf) - Install MPI


### Running
